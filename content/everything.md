## FAQ
Q: Why are you taking so many courses? I enjoy learning and kind of have had a spiraling effect since enrolling into a couple MOOCs during the pandemic era of virtual learning. I'm also scared of a robot replacing my 9-5 and like staying on top of my learning & growth

Q: When are you gonna stop?
Not sure, I'm currently looking at OMSCS and OMSCA at GT & OMSCS at UT-Austin. The <$11k tuition tag seems too good to pass up. I'll slow down eventually hehe
