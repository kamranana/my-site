Welcome 👋

Hi, I'm Ana. 
Currently a grad student studying Cybersecurity @ NYU Tandon... whilst wrapping up a CS degree @ Merrimack College.
This is my attempt to keep track of my coursework as I rate and review every online Master's course I've taken (there are a lot).


This is my personal site. Check out **[posts](/posts)**.
