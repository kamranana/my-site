Hi, I’m Ana.

I’m documenting coursework, projects, and notes as I work through my CS journey. Currently a grad student studying Cybersecurity @ NYU Tandon... whilst wrapping up a CS degree @ Merrimack College.

This is my attempt to keep track of my coursework as I rate and review every online Master's course I've taken (there are a lot).
