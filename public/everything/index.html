Algorithms &amp; Discrete Stuctures. First forray into the world of algorithms. I found the pace initially difficult to keep up with. Decent structure of course</p>
<p>Summer 2025, Merrimack College
Advanced Algorithms. A lot of studying! By this time, I had gotten accustomed to thinking &ldquo;like a programmer&rdquo; and was able to apply knowledge gained in Algorithms &amp; Discrete Structures to build upon my skillset</p>
<p>Summer 2025, Merrimack College
Languages, Automata &amp; Decidability. Hardest course I&rsquo;ve taken this far (unfortunately, also received a less than acceptable grade rip). Learning curve was STEEP &ndash; still having flashbacks to this course omg</p>
<p>Fall 2025, Merrimack College
Software Design &amp; Documentation. I loved this course! Professor GK left a strong impression on me &ndash; solid course, I love SLDC-stuff</p>
<p>Fall 2025, Merrimack College
Database Principles. I no longer hate SQL! This was a well-built out class that delved into relational databases, query optimization, etc. Learned a lot</p>
<p>Spring 2026, Merrimack College
Systems + Languages Survey (In Progress)</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<p>Q: Why are you taking so many courses? I enjoy learning and kind of have had a spiraling effect since enrolling into a couple MOOCs during the pandemic era of virtual learning. I&rsquo;m also scared of a robot replacing my 9-5 and like staying on top of my learning &amp; growth</p>
<p>Q: When are you gonna stop?
Not sure, I&rsquo;m currently looking at OMSCS and OMSCA at GT &amp; OMSCS at UT-Austin. The &lt;$11k tuition tag seems too good to pass up. I&rsquo;ll slow down eventually hehe</p>
